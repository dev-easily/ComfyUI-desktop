# Creating unit tests

- This project uses `vitest` for unit testing
- Tests are stored in the `tests/unit/` directory
  - Directory structure of `tests/unit/` should match that of the tested file in `src/`
- Tests should be cross-platform compatible; able to run on Windows, macOS, and linux
  - e.g. the use of `path.join` and `path.sep` to ensure tests work the same on all platforms
- Tests should be mocked properly
  - Mocks should be cleanly written and easy to understand
  - Mocks should be re-usable where possible
  - Class mocks should be stored in a separate file and imported for use
- Read at least five existing unit tests to determine testing patterns
  - [appState.test.ts](mdc:tests/unit/main-process/appState.test.ts) is a good example
  - [desktopApp.test.ts](mdc:tests/unit/desktopApp.test.ts) is a good example
